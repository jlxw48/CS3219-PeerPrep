# What is PeerPrep?

PeerPrep is a web application that empowers students to better take on coding assessments during interviews. With many <b>algorithmic questions</b> in our database, you can put your coding skills to the test by solving these questions with another student! We have a <b>collaborative text editor</b> and <b>real-time chat</b> that allows you to discuss with your peers on how to write the best code for your interviews.

## During an interview 🖥
There are three main components of the interview page.

#### The question
The question that you see will be the same as the one that your partner sees.

#### The code editor
The code editor allows you and your interview partner to collaborate on the question. You will be able to see what your partner types **in real time**! We currently only support **Python**, **Java** and **CPP**, but we plan to add support for other programming languages in the future 😄. 

#### The chat
The chat window can be expanded and collapsed with a click of a button. It allows you to conveniently communicate your ideas with your partner.

    <b>Note</b>: Due to our limited compute resources as a start up, we have a concurrent interview limit of 5 (10 users can interview at any time).
    To ensure that all users have an equal chance to use our awesome application, we enforce a 1 hour time limit for all interviews. Your interview will also be ended if you remain inactive for more than 10 minutes.
